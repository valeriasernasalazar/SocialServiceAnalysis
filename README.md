# SocialServiceAnalysis

The Social Service department at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey is implementing machine learning techniques to analyze survey results and understand the emotional state of students upon completing their academic period. The proposed solution involves developing a predictive model based on sentiment analysis to accurately predict responses, eliminating the need for manual analysis. To achieve this, various machine learning algorithms were tested and compared, with the neural network model proving to be the most suitable for predicting student sentiment. A user-friendly dashboard was created to visualize the results and provide valuable insights for decision-making, and it allows for data filtering and offers a clear interface with visual representations of the sentiment analysis and identified clusters. The next steps involve further refining the models, implementing clustering algorithms, and leveraging the dashboard's capabilities for deeper insights and decision-making. Overall, the project has successfully provided a comprehensive solution for analyzing student sentiment and improving the social service experience.
